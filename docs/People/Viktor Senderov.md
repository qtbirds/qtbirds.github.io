## Postdoctoral researcher 2022 – 2024

Previous postdocs, research positions, and PhD:

- [Ronquist Lab (Bioinformatics) of the Swedish Museum of Natural History](https://ronquistlab.github.io/people.html#viktor): Bayesian modeling of phylogenetics

## Employment Opportunity

I am interested in permanent positions or permanent-track positions that will allow me to pursue data science research for the benefit of biology.  My primary scientific interests are intelligent databases (more recently knowledge-backed conversational agents) and modeling languages.  I have been a leader of two large academic software projects—the [OpenBiodiv](https://openbiodiv.net) semantic database and the [TreePPL](https://treeppl.org) probabilistic programming language—so I am open to applied and managerial positions, not only pure research.  Here, you can read a [research statement](attachments/NRM_5__Long_term_research_agenda.pdf) from me and my [CV](attachments/NRM_1__CV_academic.pdf) as of the end 2023.
