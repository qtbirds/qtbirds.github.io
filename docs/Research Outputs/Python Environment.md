Since Bayesian models are implemented in TreePPL and WebPPL, which are modeling languages, we need some higher-level code to do graphics, data formatting, batch processing, etc.  You can find this code under [https://github.com/vsenderov/qtbirds.py](https://github.com/vsenderov/qtbirds.py).  There are two branches: `main` and `mcmc`.  The `mcmc` branch attempts to leverage the latest MCMC developments from TreePPL, but as they were not stable as of 2024-09-26, it is not yet merged and will probably be broken with future TreePPL releases.  Look at `examples` on how to use this.
