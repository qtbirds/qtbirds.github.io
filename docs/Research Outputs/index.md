# Research Outputs

## Presentations and Posters

On 23 – 27 July 2023 the project was presented at the joint ISMB/ECCB[^1] [congress](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2023-general-info/about-ismb-eccb-2023) in Lyon, France with a [poster](ISMB%20-%20ECCB%202023%20Poster.md) and a [presentation](ISMB%20-%20ECCB%202023%20Presentation.md).  As a result of my presentation, I was invited to give a [keynote at the University of Galway research days](https://vsenderov.github.io/2024-galway-slides/), which heavily featured the QT project.
