The QT model will be part of the official [TreePPL release](https://treeppl.org).

However, until then use [https://github.com/vsenderov/qtbirds.tppl](https://github.com/vsenderov/qtbirds.tppl).

  - `qt-1.tppl`: Inference for [Algorithm 1](../QT%20Model.md#algorithm-1)
  - `qt-2.tppl`: Inference for [Algorithm 2](../QT%20Model.md#algorithm-2)
  - `qtbirds.tppl`: (deprecated) older version of the inference, where I was experimenting with uniform priors
