## Quantitative Tools for Assessing the Correlated Evolution of Genes and Phenotypes: Application to Birds Color Patterns (Q-T-Birds)

Welcome to the Q-T-Birds project archival website.  Q-T-Birds was an active postdoc project between 2022 – 2024 by [Viktor Senderov](People/Viktor%20Senderov.md) (I am going to use the first person pronoun on this website) based in [Hélène Morlon’s lab](https://www.phyloeco.bio.ens.psl.eu/index.html) at the biology institute ([IBENS](https://www.ibens.bio.ens.psl.eu/)) of the École normale supérieure, Paris, with [collaborators](People/Collaborators.md) from College de France.

Its initial aim was to develop a comparative phylogenetics method for molecular evolution that could highlight genes that are potentially key to the formation of color patterns across bird species.  [Here, you can download the project proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zzx2PMLN4TcJT1KnUxx0BhiW_N30X8Nw/view?usp=sharing), which is password-protected for confidentiality reasons.

During the course of the project we realized that the proposed modeling approach could accommodate any biological system, where we would like to link a molecular evolution process to a phenotypic evolution process, while incorporating phylogenetic information, and doing so in the context of a full gene, as opposed to on a site-by-site basis.  So we refer to the model as the [QT Model](QT%20Model.md).

Furthermore, as a secondary objective, we set out to use the universal probabilistic programming language [TreePPL](https://treeppl.org), of which I am the main developer, to the Bayesian analysis.

You can check out various [research outputs](Research%20Outputs/index.md) of the project.

As of 2024-09-26 the current status of the project is paused, as I am unemployed.  I am interested in an [employment opportunity](People/Viktor%20Senderov.md#employment-opportunity) that would allow me to continue working on it or in transferring the project to a new leas. [Contact me](People/Viktor%20Senderov.md#contacts) if you want to discuss either option.
